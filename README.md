This is a telegram bot which solves the Sudoku problem. All we need to do is to capture the image of Sudoku and send it to this bot. The bot will respond in the form of image by overlaying the solution on the input image.

## Technologies Used

* [Telegram bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api)
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
* CNN Model

## How It Works

1. After receiving the image of sudoku from the user, the Sudoku is located in the
   image by finding the biggest square with the help of contuors and crop that part from the image. 
2. Next task is to find the atomic box in the sudoku. Same contour logic is used again to get all the boxes containing digits and empty boxes. 
3. Then the digit in each non-empty cell/box of the sudoku is predicted by using LeNet-5 model trained to predict the digits. 
4. Finally sudoku is converted to a 2-D array form and algorithm solves the sudoku problem.
5. The digits required to fill in the empty boxes are written on the image and is sent to the user.

### Big Libraries

JS libraries > 10 kB in size.

This preset includes headless Chrome, and will measure your lib’s execution
time. You likely don’t need this overhead for a small 2 kB lib, but for larger
ones the execution time is a more accurate and understandable metric that
the size in bytes. Library like [React] is a good example for this preset.

<details><summary><b>Show instructions</b></summary>

1. Install preset:

    ```sh
    $ npm install --save-dev size-limit @size-limit/preset-big-lib
    ```

2. Add the `size-limit` section and the `size` script to your `package.json`:

    ```diff
    + "size-limit": [
    +   {
    +     "path": "dist/react.production-*.js"
    +   }
    + ],
      "scripts": {
        "build": "webpack ./scripts/rollup/build.js",
    +   "size": "npm run build && size-limit",
        "test": "jest && eslint ."
      }
    ```

3. If you use ES modules you can test the size after tree-shaking with `import`
   option:

    ```diff
      "size-limit": [
        {
          "path": "dist/react.production-*.js",
    +     "import": "{ createComponent }"
        }
      ],
    ```

4. Here’s how you can get the size for your current project:

    ```sh
    $ npm run size

      Package size: 30.08 kB with all dependencies, minified and gzipped
      Loading time: 602 ms   on slow 3G
      Running time: 214 ms   on Snapdragon 410
      Total time:   815 ms
    ```

5. Now, let’s set the limit. Add 25% to the current total time and use that
   as the limit in your `package.json`:

    ```diff
      "size-limit": [
        {
    +     "limit": "1 s",
          "path": "dist/react.production-*.js"
        }
      ],
    ```

6. Add a `size` script to your test suite:

    ```diff
      "scripts": {
        "build": "rollup ./scripts/rollup/build.js",
        "size": "npm run build && size-limit",
    -   "test": "jest && eslint ."
    +   "test": "jest && eslint . && npm run size"
      }
    ```

7. If you don’t have a continuous integration service running, don’t forget
   to add one — start with [Travis CI].
8. Add the library size to docs, it will help users to choose your project:

    ```diff
      # Project Name

      Short project description

      * **Fast.** 10% faster than competitor.
    + * **Small.** 15 kB (minified and gzipped).
    +   [Size Limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) controls the size.
    ```

</details>


### Small Libraries

JS libraries < 10 kB in size.

This preset will only measure the size, without the execution time, so it’s
suitable for small libraries. If your library is larger, you likely want
the Big Libraries preset above. [Nano ID] or [Storeon] are good examples
for this preset.

<details><summary><b>Show instructions</b></summary>

1. First, install `size-limit`:

    ```sh
    $ npm install --save-dev size-limit @size-limit/preset-small-lib
    ```

2. Add the `size-limit` section and the `size` script to your `package.json`:

    ```diff
    + "size-limit": [
    +   {
    +     "path": "index.js"
    +   }
    + ],
      "scripts": {
    +   "size": "size-limit",
        "test": "jest && eslint ."
      }
    ```

3. Here’s how you can get the size for your current project:

    ```sh
    $ npm run size

      Package size: 177 B with all dependencies, minified and gzipped
    ```

4. If your project size starts to look bloated, run `--why` for analysis:

    ```sh
    $ npm run size -- --why
    ```

5. Now, let’s set the limit. Determine the current size of your library,
   add just a little bit (a kilobyte, maybe) and use that as the limit
   in your `package.json`:

    ```diff
     "size-limit": [
        {
    +     "limit": "9 kB",
          "path": "index.js"
        }
     ],
    ```

6. Add the `size` script to your test suite:

    ```diff
      "scripts": {
        "size": "size-limit",
    -   "test": "jest && eslint ."
    +   "test": "jest && eslint . && npm run size"
      }
    ```

7. If you don’t have a continuous integration service running, don’t forget
   to add one — start with [Travis CI].
8. Add the library size to docs, it will help users to choose your project:

    ```diff
      # Project Name

      Short project description

      * **Fast.** 10% faster than competitor.
    + * **Small.** 500 bytes (minified and gzipped). No dependencies.
    +   [Size Limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) controls the size.
    ```

## Reports

Size Limit has a [GitHub action] that comments and rejects pull requests based
on Size Limit output.

1. Install and configure Size Limit as shown above.
2. Add the following action inside `.github/workflows/size-limit.yml`

```yaml
name: "size"
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  size:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      CI_JOB_NUMBER: 1
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: andresz1/size-limit-action@v1.0.0
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```


## Config

Size Limits supports three ways to define config.

1. `size-limit` section in `package.json`:

   ```json
     "size-limit": [
       {
         "path": "index.js",
         "import": "{ createStore }",
         "limit": "500 ms"
       }
     ]
   ```

2. or a separate `.size-limit.json` config file:

   ```js
   [
     {
       "path": "index.js",
       "import": "{ createStore }",
       "limit": "500 ms"
     }
   ]
   ```

3. or a more flexible `.size-limit.js` or `.size-limit.cjs` config file:

   ```js
   module.exports = [
     {
       path: "index.js",
       import: "{ createStore }",
       limit: "500 ms"
     }
   ]
   ```

Each section in the config can have these options:

* **path**: relative paths to files. The only mandatory option.
  It could be a path `"index.js"`, a [pattern] `"dist/app-*.js"`
  or an array `["index.js", "dist/app-*.js", "!dist/app-exclude.js"]`.
* **import**: partial import to test tree-shaking. It could be `"{ lib }"`
  to test `import { lib } from 'lib'` or `{ "a.js": "{ a }", "b.js": "{ b }" }`
  to test multiple files.
* **limit**: size or time limit for files from the `path` option. It should be
  a string with a number and unit, separated by a space.
  Format: `100 B`, `10 kB`, `500 ms`, `1 s`.
* **name**: the name of the current section. It will only be useful
  if you have multiple sections.
* **entry**: when using a custom webpack config, a webpack entry could be given.
  It could be a string or an array of strings.
  By default, the total size of all entry points will be checked.
* **webpack**: with `false` it will disable webpack.
* **running**: with `false` it will disable calculating running time.
* **gzip**: with `false` it will disable gzip compression.
* **brotli**: with `true` it will use brotli compression and disable gzip compression.
* **config**: a path to a custom webpack config.
* **ignore**: an array of files and dependencies to exclude from
  the project size calculation.
* **modifyWebpackConfig**: (.size-limit.js only) function that can be used to 
  do last-minute changes to the webpack config, like adding a plugin.

If you use Size Limit to track the size of CSS files, make sure to set
`webpack: false`. Otherwise, you will get wrong numbers, because webpack
inserts `style-loader` runtime (≈2 kB) into the bundle.

## Plugins and Presets

Plugins:

* `@size-limit/file` checks the size of files with Gzip, Brotli
  or without compression.
* `@size-limit/webpack` adds your library to empty webpack project
  and prepares bundle file for `file` plugin.
* `@size-limit/time` uses headless Chrome to track time to execute JS.
* `@size-limit/dual-publish` compiles files to ES modules with [`dual-publish`]
  to check size after tree-shaking.

Plugin presets:

* `@size-limit/preset-app` contains `file` and `time` plugins.
* `@size-limit/preset-big-lib` contains `webpack`, `file`, and `time` plugins.
* `@size-limit/preset-small-lib` contains `webpack` and `file` plugins.

[`dual-publish`]: https://github.com/ai/dual-publish


## JS API

```js
const sizeLimit = require('size-limit')
const filePlugin = require('@size-limit/file')
const webpackPlugin = require('@size-limit/webpack')

sizeLimit([filePlugin, webpackPlugin], [filePath]).then(result => {
  result //=> { size: 12480 }
})
```
